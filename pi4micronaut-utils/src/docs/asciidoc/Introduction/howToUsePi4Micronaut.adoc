=== How to use the Pi4Micronaut library

This section will walk you through the process of creating a basic
Micronaut application and the configuration for developing
with Pi4Micronaut. As a demo, this will include the configuration and sample code.

==== Creating A Micronaut Project
. Go to Micronaut's website https://micronaut.io/launch/[here].
. Make sure you have selected Micronaut version 3.10.1 or lower with Java version 17.
. Click Generate Project and download the zip.
. Export the contents of the zip file and open it in IntelliJ or any IDE of your choice.
+
It should look like:

==== Add Dependency
. Go to the build.gradle file and find the dependencies.
. Add the Pi4Micronaut dependency to the list.
+
[source, gradle]
----
implementation("io.github.oss-slu:pi4micronaut-utils:v1.1:all")
----
+
It should look like:

==== Setup Configuration
. Go to the application.yml file and add the configuration of your circuit setup:
+
path: Demo_Pi4Micronaut/src/main/resources/application.yml
. Create a new tree in the yml file as shown below.
+
[source, yaml]
----
pi4j:
    digital-output:
        led:
            name: LED
            address: 17
            shutdown: LOW
            initial: LOW
            provider: pigpio-digital-output
----
+
Here we are specifying a led as a digital output type with name LED, address 17, etc.
For more information on the LED setup guide, see our documentation https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/#_led[here].
+
It should look like:

==== Creating Component Class
. Create a new class in the project's src directory as shown below.
+
path: Demo_Pi4Micronaut/src/main/java/com.demoPi4Micronaut
+
This is where you use the implemented LED functions from Pi4Micronaut library.

. Our example code is:
