=== Build and Run the Jar File on Raspberry Pi
This section describes how to build and run the jar file from the Pi4Micronaut project demo on your raspberry pi.

==== Set up Raspberry Pi OS
. Start by installing the Raspberry Pi Imager
. To install the Imager, follow this guide by the Raspberry Pi Foundation
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#install-using-imager[here].
+
Note: use the same wifi network for your raspberry pi that your system is connected to
. Your configuration should look something like this:
+

+

==== Connecting to Raspberry Pi
. Get your Raspberry Pi plugged into a power source.
. You can connect to your Pi several different ways.
.. Using the hostname, for example:
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh {username}@{hostname}
----
+
Using our above example configuration:
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh test@raspberrypi-test
----

.. Using the IP address of your Pi:
+
Follow the instructions outlined in this article
https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-s/en/latest/get_started_with_raspberry_pi.html#get-the-ip-address[here].

==== Installing Java
. First, make sure your Raspberry Pi's package list is up-to-date by running the following commands in your Pi's terminal:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
----
. Next, install Java onto your Pi by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get install default-jdk -y
----
To verify installation, run
+
[source, bash]
----
java --version
----
+
Finally, install pigpio
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get install pigpio
----

==== Build and Copy Over Jar File
. Open your terminal of choice
. Navigate to the project root directory
. Enter the following command into the terminal to build the jar file:
+
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew build
----
+
image:build.png[]
. The necessary jar file can be found under "Demo_Pi4Micronaut/build/libs/Demo_Pi4Micronaut-0.1-all.jar"
+
image:Locate_Jar_File.png[]
. Once you have navigated to this directory, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
scp Demo_Pi4Micronaut-0.1-all.jar {username}@{hostname}:~
----
+
.. Here is an example command, that looks like
+
[source, bash]
----
scp Demo_Pi4Micronaut-0.1-all.jar test@raspberrypi-test:~
----
+

==== Almost Done!
. To test if you've set up everything correctly on your raspberry pi, we have some sample commands for you to run.
. Open a new terminal and ssh into your raspberry pi.
. Enter the following command to run the jar file:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo java -jar Demo_Pi4Micronaut-0.1-all.jar
----
+
The output should look like this:
+

+
With this, a Micronaut localhost server will start running on your machine

.  Let's test the https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/#_led[LED] component which you have setup.

. After getting everything set up, open up a new terminal and ssh into your pi once more.

. Enter the following command to test the turn on function for an LED light:
+
[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/led/ledOn
----

. If this command works and the LED has lit up, congratulations! You have successfully built and ran one of our components!

==== Enabling Different Communication Protocols
. In the Pi4Micronaut library, we have used different communication protocols, such as I2C, SPI, etc.
. To enable any of these protocols when needed, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo raspi-config
----
+
. Navigate to "*Interfacing Options*"
+
image::commProtocol1.png[]
+
. Choose your desired protocol
+

+
. Reboot when prompted to
