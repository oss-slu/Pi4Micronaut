The Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a communication protocol used to transfer data between the Raspberry Pi and peripheral devices. These peripheral devices may be either sensors or actuators.

Many different devices use the SPI protocol, such as SD card reader modules, RFID card reader modules, and 2.4 GHz wireless transmitter/receivers all use SPI to communicate with the Raspberry Pi.

SPI uses 4 separate connections to communicate with the target device:

- COPI (Controller Output/Peripheral Input) – Line for the Controller to send data to the Peripherals.

- CIPO (Controller Input/Peripheral Output) – Line for the Peripherals to send data to the Controller.

- SCLK (Clock) – Line for the clock signal.

- PS/CS (Peripheral Select/Chip Select) – Line for the Controller to select which Peripheral to send data to.


====
*Note:*

Controller/Peripheral is formerly referred to as Master/Slave. In order to move away from the use of such terminology, we have opted to use the term Controller in place of Master, and Peripheral in place of Slave.

To define in application.yaml add spi as a field under pi4j, then add each component under spi.

Each component will need:

* name: Name of the component
* address: Address for Controller/Peripheral
* baud: Baud rate/data rate
* reset-pin: Address of GPIO reset pin

.Example SPI declaration
[source,yaml]
----
include::../../../../../../components/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=spi]
----
<1> Component Identifier (Used in @Named annotations)
<2> Component Name
<3> TO DO: Figure out what this address is
<4> Baud rate
<5> Address of GPIO Reset pin
