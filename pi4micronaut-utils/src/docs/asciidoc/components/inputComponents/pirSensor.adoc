==== PIR Sensor

===== Overview

This section provides details of the PIR Sensor, including the components and assembly instructions. A Passive Infrared Sensor measures infrared light radiating from objects to detect motion.

===== Components

* PIR Sensor
* Breadboard
* T-Extension Board
* Jumper wires x 3
* Power source (5V)
* 3 x 220Î© resistors
* RGB LED

===== Assembly Instructions
When looking at the bottom of PIR, the pins from left to right are:

. Power: connect the left pin on the PIR to 5V0 on the breadboard
. I/O: connect the middle pin on the PIR to GPIO 13 on the breadboard
. Ground: connect right pin on the PIR to GND on the breadboard
. Set up the RGB LED

===== Circuit Diagram

===== Functionality

Use `curl http://localhost:8080/pirSensor/enable` to enable the sensor. Once the sensor is enabled, anytime the sensor detects motion, the RGB LED will turn red. If no motion is detected, the RGB LED will be green.

Use `curl http://localhost:8080/pirSensor/disable` to disable the sensor.


===== Troubleshooting
- Sensor not detecting something:
    * Make sure the object is moving. The sensor only detects movement. Once an object stops moving, it is no longer detected.

===== Constructor and Methods
The constructor and the methods within the PIRSensorHelper class can be seen in our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/inputdevices/PIRSensorHelper.html[here].

===== Example Controller

====== This controller uses the PIR Sensor to turn an RGB LED red if motion is detected, green otherwise
