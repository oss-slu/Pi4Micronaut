===== Overview
This document provides details of the Ultrasonic Sensor circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. HC SR04
. T-Extension Board
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Circuit Diagram

===== Functionality
The Ultrasonic Sensor uses sound waves to calculate the distance from itself to the surface it is pointed at.
The resulting measurement is accurate within a range of 3mm of the true measurement.
The Ultrasonic Sensor's signal is stable within 5m of the sensor, gradually weakening until the signal fully disappears at 7m.

===== Testing

Use the below commands to test the component.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/ultraSound/enable
----

* `/enable`      - turns on ultrasonic sensor, starts measuring distance
* `/distance/cm` - returns distance to nearest object in centimeters
* `/distance/m`  - returns distance to nearest object in meters
* `/disable`     - turns off ultrasonic sensor



===== Troubleshooting
. Distance measurements not showing: Check all connections, ensure the sensor is placed correctly,
and check the power source.

===== YAML Configuration
The order for declaring the Trigger and Echo Pins of the Ultrasonic Sensor is as follows:

So the Trigger Pin would be connected to GPIO 23 and the Echo Pin would be connected to GPIO 24.
