===== Functionality
The Ultrasonic Sensor uses sound waves to calculate the distance from itself to the surface it is pointed at.
The resulting measurement is accurate within 3mm and has a stable signal within 5m of the sensor,
gradually weakening until fully it fully disappears at 7m.

===== Troubleshooting
. Distance measurements not showing: Check all connections, ensure the sensor is placed correctly,
and check the power source.

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring the Trigger Pin for the Ultrasonic Sensor is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
  ultra-sonic-trig:
    address: 23
----
So the Trigger Pin would be connected to GPIO 23.

The order for declaring the Echo Pin for the Ultrasonic Sensor is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  ultra-sonic-echo:
    address: 24
----
So the Echo Pin would be connected to GPIO 24.
