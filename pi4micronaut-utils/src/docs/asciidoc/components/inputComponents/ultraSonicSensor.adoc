===== Functionality
The Ultrasonic Sensor uses sound waves to calculate the distance from itself to the surface it is pointed at.
The resulting measurement is accurate within a range of 3mm of the true measurement.
The Ultrasonic Sensor's signal is stable within 5m of the sensor, gradually weakening until the signal fully disappears at 7m.

Some information about the trigger and echo signals (from the sunfounder docs):
The timing diagram is shown below. You only need to supply a short 10us pulse for the trigger input to start the ranging,
and then the module will send out an 8 cycle burst of ultrasound at 40 kHz and raise its echo.
You can calculate the range through the time interval between sending trigger signal and receiving echo signal.

Formula: us / 58 = centimeters or us / 148 =inch; or: the range = high level time * velocity (340M/S) / 2;
you are suggested to use measurement cycle over 60ms in order to prevent signal collisions of trigger signal and the echo signal.

===== Troubleshooting
. Distance measurements not showing: Check all connections, ensure the sensor is placed correctly,
and check the power source.

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring the Trigger Pin for the Ultrasonic Sensor is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
  ultra-sonic-trig:
    address: 23
----
So the Trigger Pin would be connected to GPIO 23.

The order for declaring the Echo Pin for the Ultrasonic Sensor is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  ultra-sonic-echo:
    address: 24
----
So the Echo Pin would be connected to GPIO 24.
