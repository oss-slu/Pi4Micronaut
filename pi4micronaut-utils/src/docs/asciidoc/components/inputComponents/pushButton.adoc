===== Overview
This document provides details of the Push Button circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. LED light
. Push button
. 1 x 10立 resistor
. 1 x 220立 resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Circuit Diagram

===== Functionality
On click of a button can either open or close the circuit based on its current state.

===== Testing
Use below command to test the component.

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/pushButton/init
----
* `/init`  - Initializes the Push Button for use.

===== Troubleshooting
. LED not lighting up: Check all connections, ensure the LED is placed correctly,
and check the power source.
. LED is too dim: The resistor value might be too high. Ensure you're using the correct resistors or
adjust according to your power source and LED specifications

===== YAML Configuration
The order for declaring the pin for the LED is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  led:
    name: LED Output
    address: 17
    shutdown: LOW
    initial: LOW
    provider: pigpio-digital-output
----
So the LED would be connected to GPIO 17.

The order for declaring the pin for the push button is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
    button-input-3:
      name: Push Button Input
      address: 18
      pull: PULL_DOWN
      debounce: 30
      provider: pigpio-digital-input
----
So the push button would be connected to GPIO 18.

===== Constructor and Methods

To see the constructor and methods of our PushButtonHelper class see our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/inputdevices/PushButtonHelper.html[here]
for more details.


===== An Example Controller

====== This controller uses the push button to turn an LED on and off
