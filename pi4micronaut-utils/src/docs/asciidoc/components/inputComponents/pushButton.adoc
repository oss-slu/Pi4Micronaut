including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. LED light
. Push button
. 1 x 10立 resistor
. 1 x 220立 resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Circuit Diagram
Model:

* Note the 220立 resistor is for the LED and the 10立 for the button.

===== Functionality
A push of the button turns the LED light on and another push turns it off.

===== Troubleshooting
. LED not lighting up: Check all connections, ensure the LED is placed correctly,
and check the power source.
. LED is too dim: The resistor value might be too high. Ensure you're using the correct resistors or
adjust according to your power source and LED specifications

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring the pin for the LED is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  led:
    address: 17
----
So the LED would be connected to GPIO 17.

The order for declaring the pin for the push button is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
  button-input-3:
    address: 18
----
So the push button would be connected to GPIO 18.
