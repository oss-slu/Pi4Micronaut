===== Overview

This section provides details of a tilt switch sensor implementation, including its circuit diagram,
required hardware components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components

. Tilt switch module
. LED light
. 1 x 220Ω resistor
. 1 x 1kΩ resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Assembly Instructions

. Ground: Place the ground so that it is connected to the tilt switch and the LED
. Power: Place the power (3.3V) so that power is given to both the LED and tilt switch
. Resistor (220Ω): Place the 220Ω resistor vertically so that it can connect the LED light to power
. Resistor (1kΩ): Place the 1kΩ resistor vertically so that it can provide power to the tilt switch
. Connect a wire from GPIO26 to the LED which is its digital output
. Attach a wire from GPIO17 to the tilt switch which is its digital input

See the circuit diagram below for more detail.

===== Functionality

When the tilt switch is tilted or its orientation is changed, a metal ball moves inside the capsule
and opens or closes an electrical circuit, altering the state of the switch.
Our example showcases a tilt switch and LED which lights up when the tilt switch is enabled and detects a change in orientation.

===== Testing the Circuit

Use the below commands to test the tilt switch.

* `/enable`  - turns on tilt switch
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/tiltSwitch/enable
----

* `/disable` - turns off tilt switch
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/tiltSwitch/disable
----

===== Troubleshooting

- LED not lighting up once it has been enabled and is being tilted:
. Make sure that the correct GPIO pins are being used for the LED and Tilt Switch as specified in the yml.
. Confirm that everything is properly secured to the breadboard and is receiving power.
. Ensure a 220Ω is being used for the LED and 1kΩ resistor for the Tilt Switch.

===== YAML Configuration

The YAML configuration for the LED is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  led2:
    name: LED Output
    address: 26
    shutdown: HIGH
    initial: HIGH
    provider: pigpio-digital-output
----
So, the output of the LED is connected to GPIO 26.

The YAML configuration for the tilt switch is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
  tilt-switch-input:
    name: Tilt Switch Input
    address: 17
    pull: PULL_DOWN
    debounce: 5000
    provider: pigpio-digital-input
----
So, the input of the tilt switch is connected to GPIO 17.

===== Constructor and Methods

To see the constructor and methods of our TiltSwitchHelper class see our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/inputdevices/TiltSwitchHelper.html[here]
for more details.

===== An Example Controller

====== This controller uses the tilt switch to light up a LED light once it is tilted
