===== Overview

This section provides details of a touch switch sensor implementation,
including its circuit diagram, required hardware components,
assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components

. Touch switch module
. LED light
. 1 x 220Ω resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Assembly Instructions

Connect the 3 pins on the touch switch to the breadboard as well as the LED and resistor
making sure the LED has power.

. Ground: connect the ground on the touch switch to the ground on the breadboard
. Power: Connect the VCC on the touch switch to the 3.3V on the breadboard
.. You will want to have a wire connecting 3.3V and ground to the bottom of the board
so that power can be supplied to the LED and touch switch as shown in the diagram below
. IO: Connect the IO on the touch switch to GPIO 17 on the breadboard which is the digital input
. Resistor: Place the resistor vertically so that it can connect the LED light to power
. Connect a wire from GPIO26 to the LED which is its digital output

===== Functionality

Once the touch switch has been enabled, touching the sensor will turn the LED light on
and removing your finger from the sensor will turn the LED light off.

===== Testing the Circuit

To enable the touch switch:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/touchSwitch/enable
----

To disable the touch switch:

[source, bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/touchSwitch/disable
----

===== Troubleshooting

- LED not lighting up once it has been enabled and is being touched:
Make sure that all the pins on the touch switch are in the right spot and that everything is receiving power.
Also make sure that everything is properly secured to the breadboard.
- Ensure a 220Ω resistor is being used

===== YAML Pin Order

The order for declaring the pin for the LED is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-output:
  led2:
    address: 26
----
So, the output of the LED is connected to GPIO 26.

The order for declaring the pin for the touch switch is as follows:

[source, yaml]
----
digital-input:
  touch-switch-input:
    address: 17
----
So, the input of the touch switch is connected to GPIO 17.

===== Constructor

[source, java]
----
public TouchSwitchHelper(DigitalInput touchSwitchInput)
----

===== Methods

[source, java]
----
public void initialize()
public void addEventListener(DigitalStateChangeListener function)
public void removeEventListener()
----

===== An Example Controller

====== This controller uses the touch switch to light up a LED light once touched
