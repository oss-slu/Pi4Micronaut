===== Overview
This section provides the details of the PhotoResistor Sensor, also known as the light sensor, circuit, including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x LED
* 1 x PhotoResistor Sensor
* 1 x 220Ω Resistor
* 1 x Capacitor (10µf)
* 2 x 10KΩ Resistor
* 4 Jumper Wires
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V or 5V)


===== Assembly Instructions
* Place the PhotoResistor onto the breadboard.
* Place the LED onto the breadboard with the Cathode in the negative side. The Anode will be place onto the breadboard
* Place a 220Ω resistor next to the anode of the LED, then place the other pin on other side of the breadboard.
* Place one side of the Capacitor onto the negative side of the breadboard.
* Place the other side of the Capacitor into the breadboard inline with a jumper wire and a 10KΩ Resistor.
* Place the PhotoResistor Sensor onto the breadboard inline with the Capacitor, 10KΩ Resistor. The PhotoResistor should have a 10KΩ pin on either side of its' pins.
* The 10KΩ resistor pin should then be placed in line away from the PhotoResistor pins.
* Place a jumper wire from GND pin to the negative side of the board.
* Place a jumper wire from GPIO4 next to the positive pin of the Capacitor and the 10KΩ Resistor.
* Place a jumper wire from GPIO17 and place it next to the 220Ω Resistor
* Place a jumper wire from GPIO27 to the pin of the 10KΩ.

===== Functionality
PhotoResistor is a DigitalInput and DigitalOutput type that controls the LED's behavior based on changes in light intensity.


===== Testing
Use the below command to test the component.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/photoResistor/enable
----

* `/enable` - Initializes the PhotoResistor

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/photoResistor/getDarkness
----

* `/getDarkness` - returns the darkness level

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/photoResistor/disable
----

* `/disable` - Disables the photoresistor

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/photoResistor/threshold/i
----

* `/threshold/{i}` - Sets the threshold for which the LED will turn on.

===== Troubleshooting
LED not lighting:
    * Verify that the appropriate resistors are being used (220Ω)
    * Double check the power source

PhotoResistor not working:
    * Ensure that the darkness level is appropriately set
    * Verify the PhotoResistor is correctly placed into the breadboard
    * Verify the correct resistor is used (10KΩ)
