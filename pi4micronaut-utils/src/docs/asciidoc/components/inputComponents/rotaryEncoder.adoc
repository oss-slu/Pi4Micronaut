===== Overview
This section provides details of the Rotary Encoder circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. Rotary encoder module
. 1 x 10kΩ resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Assembly Instructions
Connect the 5 pins on the encoder to the breadboard along with the resistor as
stated below and in the diagram.

. Ground: Connect ground on the encoder to ground on the breadboard
. Power: Connect the + on the encoder to the 3.3V on the breadboard
. SW: Connect SW to GPIO 27 on the breadboard
. DT: Connect DT to GPIO 17 on the breadboard
. CLK: Connect CLK to GPIO 18 on the breadboard
. Resistor: Place the resistor horizontally so that it is parallel
  with GPIO 27, having one side on the red + with the other next to the wire on GPIO 27
. Connect a wire from 3.3V to the red + in the same column as the resistor

===== Circuit Diagram

- Note the resistor location at GPIO 27

===== Functionality
Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/rotaryEncoder` to test the component. These following commands will test the component:

* `/value`  - returns the current value of the rotary encoder

===== Testing the Circuit
To return the value of the rotary encoder:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rotaryEncoder/value
----

===== Troubleshooting
- Value not being returned: Make sure all pins on the encoder match up
  to the correct GPIO pins according to the YAML pin order below.
- Make sure that a 10k resistor is being used

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring pins for a Rotary Encoder component in the application.yaml file is as follows

*SW-PIN-INFO, CLK-PIN-INFO, DT-PIN-INFO*

So in the case of

[source, yaml]
----
multi-digital-input:
  rotary-encoder:
    name: Rotary Encoder
    addresses: 27,18,17
    debounces: 6000,500,500
    pulls: PULL_DOWN,PULL_UP,PULL_UP
    shutdown: LOW
    initial: HIGH
    provider: pigpio-digital-input
----

the sw pin would be the one connected to GPIO 27, the clk pin would be connected to GPIO 18, and the dt pin would connect to GPIO 17. All lists of values for Rotary Encoder components will follow the same order.

===== Constructors and Methods
To see the constructor and methods of our RotaryEncoderHelper class see our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/inputdevices/RotaryEncoderHelper.html[here]
for more details.
