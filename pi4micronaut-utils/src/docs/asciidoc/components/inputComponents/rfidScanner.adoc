===== Overview
This section provides information regarding the RFID scanner component and its circuit, including assembly instructions.


===== Components

* RFID-RC522
* RFID key fob
* 9 x Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* Power source (3.3V)




===== Assembly Instructions

* Put RFID scanner on breadboard as shown in the diagram below.
* Connect the RFID ground to the ground on the Pi, and connect the 3.3V pin of the RFID scanner to the 3V3 pin of the Pi.
* Connect the rest of the RFID pins to the corresponding pins on the Pi.


===== Circuit Diagram
Model:

image::rfid_circuit.png[]

===== Functionality
Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/rfid` to test the component. These following commands will test the component:

* `/write/{value}`  - Writes {value} to the RFID key fob
* `/read`           - Readies scanner to read key fob

===== Troubleshooting

Make sure everything is connected to the correct pins.

===== Testing the Circuit:

To write to the RFID fob: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rfid/write/{message}`

Example:
[source]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rfid/write/HelloThere
----
Scan the key fob to write the message to the fob.

To read from the RFID fob: `curl http://localhost:8080/rfid/read`

Example:
[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rfid/read
----
Scan the key fob and the message on the fob will be printed.
[source]
----
HelloThere
----

===== YAML
The RFID scanner as it appears in the application.yml:

include::../../../../../../components/src/main/resources/application.yml[tag=spi]

===== Constructors and Methods
To see the constructor and methods of our RFidHelper class see our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/inputdevices/RFidHelper.html[here]
for more details.
