===== Overview
This section provides information regarding the RFID scanner component and its circuit, including assembly instructions.

===== Components

* RFID-RC522
* RFID key fob
* 9 x Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* Power source (3.3V)

===== Assembly Instructions

* Put RFID scanner on breadboard as shown in the diagram below.
* Connect the RFID ground to the ground on the Pi, and connect the 3.3V pin of the RFID scanner to the 3V3 pin of the Pi.
* Connect the rest of the RFID pins to the corresponding pins on the Pi.


===== Circuit Diagram

===== Functionality
RFID Scanner requires RFID tags to work with. We can read/write the data on to the tags using the scanner.

* `/write/{value}`  - Writes {value} to the RFID key fob
* `/read`           - Scanner will be ready to read the key fob

===== Testing the Circuit:

To write to the RFID fob:
[source]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rfid/write/HelloThere
----
Scan the key fob to write the message to the fob.

To read from the RFID fob:
[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rfid/read
----
Scan the key fob and the message on the fob will be printed.
[source]
----
HelloThere
----

===== Troubleshooting

Make sure everything is connected to the correct pins.

===== YAML Configuration
The RFID scanner configuration as it appears in the application.yml:

[source]
----
spi:
   rfid:
      name: MFRC522
      address: 8
      baud: 500000
      reset-pin: 25
