===== Overview
This section provides the details of the Speed Sensor circuit, including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
* Speed Sensor
* Bread Board
* T-Extension Board
* 7x Jumper Cables
* Green LED Light Bulb
* Red LED Light Bulb
* 2x 220Î© Resistors
* Power source

===== Assembly Instructions
. Ground (GND): Connect the GND pin on the speed sensor to the ground rail on the breadboard.
. VCC: Connect the VCC pin on the speed sensor to the 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header via the breadboard power rail.
. Digital Output (D0): Connect the D0 pin on the speed sensor to GPIO 17 (Pin 11) on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header.
. Connect the longer leg (anode) of the red LED to a row on the breadboard.
. Place a 220-ohm resistor between the shorter leg (cathode) of the red LED and the ground rail on the breadboard.
. Use a jumper wire to connect the same row as the anode of the red LED to GPIO 27 (Pin 13) on the Raspberry Pi.
. Similarly, place the green LED on the breadboard.
. Connect the longer leg (anode) to a free row.
. Place another 220-ohm resistor between the cathode of the green LED and ground.
. Use a jumper wire to connect the anode of the green LED to GPIO 22 (Pin 15).
. Connect the ground rail on the breadboard to a ground pin (GND) on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header (e.g., Pin 6).
. Connect the power rail on the breadboard to a 5V pin on the Raspberry Pi GPIO header (e.g., Pin 2).

===== Functionality

===== Testing the Circuit:

Use the below command to test the speed sensor.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/speedSensor/enable
----

* `/enable` - Initializes the Speed Sensor

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/speedSensor/speed/rpm
----

* `/speed/rpm` - Returns the speed in RPM

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/speedSensor/speed/disable
----

* `/disable` - Disables the Speed Sensor

===== Troubleshooting

Verify that all connections are correct and that the order of components in a row are correct.

===== YAML Configuration
