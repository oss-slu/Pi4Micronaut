===== Overview

This section provides details of the DC motor, including its components and assembly instructions.

===== Components

* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-Extension Board
* 1 x DC Motor
* 10 x Jumper wires
* 1 x L293D Motor Controller IC 1
* 1 x Power supply module
* Raspberry Pi power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)
* Motor power source (for example, a 9V battery and buckle connector)

===== Assembly Instructions

* Connect the ground (GND) pin of the Raspberry Pi to the negative ground rail on the breadboard.
* Place the L293D Motor Controller on the breadboard.
* Connect a jumper wire from GND pin 5 of the L293D to the negative ground rail of the breadboard.
* Connect a jumper wire from the Vcc1 pin (pin 16) of the L293D to the positive rail of the breadboard.
* Connect a jumper wire from the Vcc2 pin (pin 8) of the L293D to the other positive rail of the breadboard.
* Connect a jumper wire from the pin GPIO17 (BCM pin 17) on the Raspberry Pi to the 2A pin (pin 7) on the L293D.
* Connect a jumper wire from the pin GPIO27 (BCM pin 27) on the Raspberry Pi to the 1A pin (pin 2) on the L293D.
* Connect a jumper wire from the pin GPIO22 (BCM pin 22) on the Raspberry Pi to the 1,2EN pin (pin 1) on the L293D.
* Connect the motor to the breadboard.
* Connect terminals of the motor to the 1Y (pin 3) and 2Y (pin 6 pins on the L293D using two jumper wires.
* Connect a jumper wire between GND pins 4 and 5 of the L293D.
* Place the power module on the breadboard.
* Connect the motor power source into the power module.

===== Functionality

Motor can be enabled or disabled, change speed to custom value 0 to 100, and switch directions between clockwise and counterclockwise.

===== Testing

Use the below commands to test the component.
This will cause the motor to turn.

[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/motor/enable
----

* `/enable` - Enables the motor.
* `/disable` - Disables the motor.
* `/setSpeed/{speed}` - Sets the speed of the motor to custom value 0 to 100.
* `/setClockwise/{clockwise}` - Sets the direction of the motor; "true" for clockwise, "false" for counterclockwise.
* `/switchDirection` - Switches the direction from clockwise to counterclockwise or vice versa.

===== Troubleshooting

* Motor does not turn on
- Ensure all connections are secure and correct.
- Check for appropriate voltage from power source.
- Check the L239D for proper orientation and placement.
- Ensure the software configuration matches the hardware setup.
- Look for any error messages in the console or logs.

* Motor turns on but does not respond to commands
- Check the software configuration for any discrepancies.
- Ensure the L239D is functioning properly.
- Check for appropriate voltage from power source.
