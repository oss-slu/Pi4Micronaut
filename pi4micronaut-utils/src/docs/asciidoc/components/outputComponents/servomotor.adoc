===== Overview
This section provides details of the Servo Motor, including the components, and assembly instructions.


===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-extension Board
* 1 x Servo-Motor
* 3 x Jumper Wires
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)

===== Assembly Instructions
* Connect a jumper wire to 3.3V
* Connect a jumper wire to GPIO 18
* Connect a jumper wire to GND
* Connect the 3.3V jumper wire to the power wire receiver (Color: Red)
* Connect the GND jumper wire to the ground wire receiver (Color: Brown or Black)
* Connect the GPIO 18 jumper wire to the signal wire receiver (Color: Orange)

===== Functionality
Servo motor is a PWM type and will rotate the arm between the angles of 0 to 180 degrees.

===== Testing the Circuit
Use the below commands to test the component.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/servoMotor/enable
----

* `/enable` - Turns the Servo Motor on.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/servoMotor/disable
----

* `/disable` - Turns the Servo Motor off.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/servoMotor/setAngle/{angle}
----

* `/setAngle/{angle}` - Sets the indicated angle for the Servo Motor.

===== Troubleshooting
- Servo Motor not rotating:
    * Verify that all wires are placed into the correct locations on the Breadboard
    * Verify that the wires are placed correctly into the wire receiver for the Servo Motor
    * Verify that the Servo Motor is enabled
