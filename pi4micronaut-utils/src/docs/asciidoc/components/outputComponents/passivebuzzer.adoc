===== Overview
This section provides details of the Passive Buzzer, including the components and assembly instructions. The Passive Buzzer emits various frequencies, as described by the code, to play music or many other frequencies.

===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-extension Board
* 1 x Passive Buzzer
* 6 x Jumper wires
* 1 x Resistor (1KΩ)
* 1 x S8550 PNP Transistor
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)

===== Assembly Instructions

* Place the Passive Buzzer onto the Breadboard.
* Place the 1KΩ resistor onto the Breadboard, must be inline with base pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Place the S8550 PNP Transistor onto the BreadBoard.
* The Passive Buzzer will have two pins of the same length.
* Connect a jumper wire from GND to (-) negative side
* Connect a jumper wire from 3.3V to (+) positive side.
* Connect a jumper wire from GPIO 17 to the 1KΩ resistor
* Connect jumper wire from positive side to positive end of Passive Buzzer.
* Connect jumper wire from negative end of Passive Buzzer to emitter pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Connect jumper wire from negative side to collector pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.

===== Functionality
Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/passive-buzzer` to test the component.  The constructor and the methods these commands call within the PassiveBuzzerHelper class can be seen in our javadoc link:https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/javadoc/com/opensourcewithslu/outputdevices/PassiveBuzzerHelper.html[here]. These following commands will test the component:

* `/enable`  - Turns the Passive Buzzer on.
* `/disable` - Turns the Passive Buzzer off.
* `/showFreq` - Displays the current frequency of the Passive Buzzer.
* `/setFreq/{frequenciesFile}` - Plays a series of frequencies from a file specified by the user.
* `/passBuzz` - Plays a 1 - second buzz.
* `/freqIter` - Cycles through different frequencies.
* `/playPiSeq` - Plays an array containing the first ten digits of pi.



===== Troubleshooting
- Passive Buzzer not creating sound:
    * Double check power source
    * Verify that 1K resistor is used
    * Verify all wires are in appropriate slots.
    * When using a file, verify that the file itself is scp'd to the raspberrypi (see PassiveBuzzerController for full information).
