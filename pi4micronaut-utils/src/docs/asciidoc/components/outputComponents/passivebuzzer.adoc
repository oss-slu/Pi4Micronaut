===== Overview
This section provides details of the passive buzzer, including the components and assembly instructions.

===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-extension Board
* 1 x Passive Buzzer
* 6 x Jumper wires
* 1 x Resistor (1KΩ)
* 1 x S8550 PNP Transistor
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)

===== Assembly Instructions

* Place the Passive Buzzer onto the Breadboard.
* Place the 1KΩ resistor onto the Breadboard, must be inline with base pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Place the S8550 PNP Transistor onto the BreadBoard.
* The Passive Buzzer will have two pins of the same length.
* Connect a jumper wire from GND to (-) negative side
* Connect a jumper wire from 3.3V to (+) positive side.
* Connect a jumper wire from GPIO 17 to the 1KΩ resistor
* Connect jumper wire from positive side to positive end of Passive Buzzer.
* Connect jumper wire from negative end of Passive Buzzer to emitter pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Connect jumper wire from negative side to collector pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.

===== Functionality
Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/passive-buzzer/enable` to test the component. This command will cause the buzzer to emit sound for a short duration.

===== Troubleshooting
- Passive Buzzer not creating sound:
    * Double check power source
    * Verify that 1K resistor is used
    * Verify all wires are in appropriate slots.
    * When using a file, verify that the file itself is scp'd to the raspberrypi (see PassiveBuzzerController for full information).
