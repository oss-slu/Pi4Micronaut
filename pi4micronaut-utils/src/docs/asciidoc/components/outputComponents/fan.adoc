===== Overview
This section provides comprehensive details about the Fan Controller component, covering its configuration, circuit setup, and usage instructions.

===== Components
* 1 x Raspberry Pi
* 1 x Fan (PWM-controlled or simple DC fan)
* Jumper wires
* Breadboard
* Power source

===== Circuit Setup

1. Connect the fan to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins as specified in the YAML configuration.
2. Use a PWM-compatible pin to control the fan speed (if the fan supports PWM).
3. Connect a common ground between the fan and the Raspberry Pi.
4. Refer to the circuit diagram for detailed wiring instructions.

===== YAML Configuration
The following YAML configuration is used to set up the Fan Controller in `application.yml`. This configuration includes parameters to control fan speed and behavior.

[source, yaml]
----
  # tag::fan[]
  fan:
    controller:
      name: "Raspberry Pi Fan Controller"
      pwm-pin:
        name: Fan PWM Pin
        address: 18
        frequency: 25000
        shutdown: LOW
        initial: LOW
        provider: pigpio-pwm-output
      speed-settings:
        low: 30
        medium: 60
        high: 100
  # end::fan[]

===== Functionality
The Fan Controller allows the Raspberry Pi to control the speed of a fan using PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) or simple on/off states. It supports predefined speed levels (e.g., low, medium, high).

===== Testing

To test the Fan Controller component with the Micronaut API, use the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/fan/speed/high
----
* `/speed/{level}` - Sets the fan speed to the specified level (`low`, `medium`, or `high`).
* `/stop` - Turns off the fan.
* `/shutdown` - Deactivates the fan completely and resets settings.

===== Troubleshooting
- **Fan not working**: Verify the fan is connected to the correct GPIO pins and ensure power is supplied to the fan.
- **Inconsistent speed**: Review the PWM frequency in the YAML configuration and ensure compatibility with the fan.

===== Example Controller

The following example controller demonstrates how to set up routes for controlling fan speed, stopping the fan, and managing shutdown features.
