===== Overview
This section provides details of the LCD1602 (Liquid Crystal Display) circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

.Note: The LCD1602 only works on the 32-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS.

===== Components
. LCD1602
. Breadboard
. T-Extension Board
. Jumper wires
. Power source (5V)

===== Assembly Instructions
Connect the 4 pins on the LCD1602 screen to the breadboard as described below and in the diagram:

. Ground: connect GND on the LCD1602 to GND on the breadboard
. Power: connect VCC on the LCD1602 to 5V0 on the breadboard
. SDA: connect SDA on the LCD1602 to SDA1 on the breadboard
. SCL: connect SCL on the LCD1602 to SCL1 on the breadboard

===== Circuit Diagram

===== Functionality

The LCD1602 is a kind of dot matrix module that can show letters, numbers, and other characters.
The number 1602 describes the display: 2 rows with 16 characters per row.

Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/lcd` to test the component. These following commands will test the component:

* `/write/{text}`                 - writes *{text}* to lcd screen
* `/write/{text}/{line}`          - writes *{text}* to lcd screen on line number *{line}*
* `/write/{text}/{line}/{pos}`    - writes *{text}* to lcd screen on line number *{line}* at pos *{pos}*
* `/write/character/{charValue}`  - writes character *{charValue}* to lcd screen
* `/backlight/{state}`            - sets backlight to *{state}* (state must be set to *"on"* or *"off"*)
* `/clear/all`                    - clears lcd screen
* `/clear/{line}`                 - clears line number {line} of lcd screen
* `/turnOff`                      - turns off lcd screen



===== Testing the Circuit
Write Hello to the LCD1602 screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/{text}
----
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/Hello
----
Write World on line 2 of LCD1602 screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/{text}/{line}
----
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/World/2
----
Turn backlight on/off
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/backlight/on
----
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/backlight/off
----
Clear entire LCD1602 screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/all
----
Clear one line on LCD1602 screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/{line}
----
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/2
----

===== Troubleshooting
1. LCD1602 screen not turning on: Check all connections, ensure the LCD1602 is placed correctly, and check the power source
2. Make sure I2C is enabled. To enable, follow these steps:

a. Type the following command:
+
.................
$ sudo raspi-config
.................
+
b. Use the arrow keys to navigate to "Interfacing Options" and press Enter.
c. Scroll down and select "I2C" using the arrow keys and press Enter.
d. When prompted whether to enable the ARM I2C interface, select "Yes."
e. Exit the configuration tool and reboot the Raspberry Pi with the following command for the changes to take effect:
+
.................
$ sudo reboot
.................

3. Make sure you are using the 32 bit version of Raspberry Pi OS. The below command should return `armv71` if running the 32 bit OS.
.................
$ uname -m
.................

===== YAML Configuration

A BCM numbering system is used. More info can be found https://pinout.xyz[here].

LCD1602 uses I2C communication for this circuit and configuration in the application.yml file is as follows
[source, yaml]
----
i2c:
  lcd:
    name: lcd
    bus: 1
    device: 0x27
