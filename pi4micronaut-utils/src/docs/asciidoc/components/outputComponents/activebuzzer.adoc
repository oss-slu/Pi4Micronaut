===== Overview
This section provides details of the Active Buzzer, including the components and assembly instructions. The Active Buzzer only emits one frequency, as described in the code, to play various sounds.

===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-extension Board
* 1 x Active Buzzer
* 6 x Jumper wires
* 1 x Resistor (1KΩ)
* 1 x S8550 PNP Transistor
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)

===== Assembly Instructions
* Place the Active Buzzer onto the Breadboard.
* Place the 1KΩ resistor onto the Breadboard, must be inline with base pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Place the S8550 PNP Transistor onto the BreadBoard.
* The Active Buzzer will have two pins. The longer pin is the anode (+) while the shorter is the cathode(-).
* Connect a jumper wire from GND to (-) negative side
* Connect a jumper wire from 3.3V to (+) positive side.
* Connect a jumper wire from GPIO 17 to the 1KΩ resistor
* Connect jumper wire from positive side to positive end of Active Buzzer.
* Connect jumper wire from negative end of Active Buzzer to emitter pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.
* Connect jumper wire from negative side to collector pin of S8550 PNP Transistor.

===== Functionality
Active Buzzer is PWM type and emits a beep tone, intermittent tone and a morseCode tone based on the frequency and the time interval.

*Note:* If you use transistor in the circuit, it swaps the functionalities of the buzzer i.e., if you enable the buzzer, it actually disables it and vice versa.

===== Testing the circuit
Use the below command to test the component.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/active-buzzer/enable
----

* `/enable`  - Turns the Active Buzzer on.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/active-buzzer/disable
----
* `/disable` - Turns the Active Buzzer off.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/active-buzzer/beepTone
----
* `/beepTone` - Emits a beep sound from the Active Buzzer.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/active-buzzer/intermittentTone
----
* `/intermittentTone` - Emits an intermittent tone from the Active Buzzer. The total duration is twenty seconds: ten seconds of sound and ten seconds of silence.

[source, bash]
----
$curl http://localhost:8080/active-buzzer/morseCode
----
* `/morseCode` - Emits the word "pi" in morse code.


===== Troubleshooting
- Active Buzzer not creating sound:
    * Double check power source
    * Verify that 1K resistor is used
    * Verify all wires are in appropriate slots.
