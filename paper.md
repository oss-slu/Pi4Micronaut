# Summary

<!-- Should use this: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02584 as an example. -->

[//]: # (We need to connect every thing to Pi4Micronaut being used for research purposes. )

# Statement of Need

these are just notes
* Researchers use various instruments for collecting data.
* Many times researches plug the instrument into their personal computer to take measurements. 
* If the instruments are connected to a raspberry pi, multiple researchers can connect and utilize the instrument remotely. 
* In most use cases, using a full computer to use an instrument is overkill. 
* Raspberry Pi's provide a smaller and cheaper alternative.  
* <!-- Find papers that use raspberry pi's with instruments that could in theory work with the Pi4Micronaut library. -->
