# Summary

For researchers, a major component of their work is data gathering. While there are many instances when they can simply 
plug the tools they are using into their personal computer, circumstances call for a more mobile or collaborative medium. 
The single board computer Raspberry Pi with its ability to interface with almost anything provides an answer. The small 
size and versatility at a low price, makes the Raspberry Pi an ideal solution for researchers. Applications for the 
Raspberry Pi include rat licking behavior (Longley, et al.), 

<!-- List research papers that use raspberry pi with components similar to those that we have implemented. -->


<!-- Should use this: https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02584 as an example. -->

[//]: # (We need to connect every thing to Pi4Micronaut being used for research purposes. )

# Statement of Need

these are just notes
* Researchers use various instruments for collecting data.
* Many times researches plug the instrument into their personal computer to take measurements. 
* If the instruments are connected to a raspberry pi, multiple researchers can connect and utilize the instrument remotely. 
* In most use cases, using a full computer to use an instrument is overkill. 
* Raspberry Pi's provide a smaller and cheaper alternative.  
* <!-- Find papers that use raspberry pi's with instruments that could in theory work with the Pi4Micronaut library. -->
