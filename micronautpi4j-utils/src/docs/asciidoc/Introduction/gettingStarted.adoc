=== Getting Started With Pi4Micronaut!
This section describes how to build and run the jar file from the Pi4Micronaut project on your raspberry pi.

Note: this is not a tutorial on how to use the Pi4Micronaut library, simply a setup guide.

==== Prerequisites
. Clone our Github repo onto your system
+
https://github.com/oss-slu/Pi4Micronaut/tree/main

==== Set up Raspberry Pi OS
. Start by installing the Raspberry Pi Imager
. To install the Imager, follow this guide by the Raspberry Pi Foundation:
+
https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/getting-started.html#install-using-imager
+
Note: use the same wifi network for your raspberry pi that your system is connected to
. Your configuration should look something like this:
+
image::imager_settings1.png[]
+
image::imager_settings2.png[]


==== Connecting to Raspberry Pi
. Get your Raspberry Pi plugged into a power source.
. You can connect to your Pi several different ways.
.. Using the hostname, for example:
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh {username}@{hostname}
----
+
Using our above example configuration:
+
[source, bash]
----
ssh test@raspberrypi-test
----

.. Using the IP address of your Pi:
+
Follow the instructions outlined in this article:
+
https://docs.sunfounder.com/projects/picar-s/en/latest/get_started_with_raspberry_pi.html#get-the-ip-address


==== Installing Java
. First, make sure your Raspberry Pi's package list is up-to-date by running the following commands in your Pi's terminal:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get upgrade -y
----
. Next, install Java onto your Pi by running the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get install default-jdk -y
----
To verify installation, run
+
[source, bash]
----
java --version
----
+
Finally, install pigpio
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo apt-get install pigpio
----

==== Build and Copy Over Jar File
. Open your terminal of choice
. Navigate to the Pi4Micronaut root directory
. Enter the following command into the terminal to build the jar file:
+
[source, bash]
----
./gradlew build
----
. The necessary components jar file can be found under "../Pi4Micronaut/components/build/libs/"
. Once you have navigated to this directory, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
scp components-0.1-all.jar {username}@{hostname}:~
----
+
.. Following our configuration from earlier, this would look like
+
[source, bash]
----
scp components-0.1-all.jar test@raspberrypi-test:~
----

==== Almost Done!
. To test if you've set up Pi4Micronaut correctly on your raspberry pi, we have some sample commands for you run.
. Open a new Windows Powershell and ssh into your raspberry pi.
. Enter the following command to run the jar file:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo java -jar components-0.1-all.jar
----
+
The output should look like this:
+
image::running_jar.png[]
+
With this, a Micronaut localhost server will start running on your machine


. Let's test one of the components. Take a look at our documentation for setting up the LED component:
+
https://oss-slu.github.io/Pi4Micronaut/#_led
. After getting everything set up, open up a new PowerShell and ssh into your pi once more.
. Enter the following command to test the turn on function for an LED light:
+
"curl http://localhost:8080/led/ledOn"
. If this command works and the LED has lit up, congratulations! You have successfully built and run one of our components!

==== Enabling Different Communication Protocols
. In the Pi4Micronaut library, we have used different communication protocols, such as I2C, SPI, etc.
. To enable any of these protocols when needed, enter the following command:
+
[source, bash]
----
sudo raspi-config
----
+
. Navigate to "*Interfacing Options*"
+
image::commProtocol1.png[]
+
. Choose your desired protocol
+

+
. Reboot when prompted to
