TODO: outline how someone can contribute to our library

There are several ways to contribute to the Pi4Micronaut framework, such as, suggesting changes to the code or documentation, bug fixes, or adding new components. Familiarity with the Micronaut framework will greatly help potential contributors understanding of how the code base works or how to implement new components. If help is needed with Micronaut related issues, reference the https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-docs-mn3/3.8.1/guide/[Micronaut Documentation] and the https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-core[Micronaut GitHub].
