===== Overview
This section provides details of the LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) circuit, including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality. The LCD is a M Ã— N pixel screen that can be used to display different images or words.

===== Components
. LCD
. Breadboard
. T-Extension Board
. Jumper wires
. Power source (5V)

===== Assembly Instructions
Connect the 4 pins on the LCD screen to the breadboard as described below and in the diagram:

. Ground: connect GND on the LCD to GND on the breadboard
. Power: connect VCC on the LCD to 5V0 on the breadboard
. SDA: connect SDA on the LCD to SDA1 on the breadboard
. SCL: connect SCL on the LCD to SCL1 on the breadboard

===== Functionality
The LCD screen will light up once connected to a power source.

===== Testing the Circuit
Write Hello to the LCD screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/{text}
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/Hello
----
Write World on line 2 of LCD screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/{text}/{line}
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/write/World/2
----
Turn backlight on/off
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/backlight/on
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/backlight/off
----
Clear entire LCD screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/all
----
Clear one line on LCD screen
[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/{line}
$ curl http://localhost:8080/lcd/clear/2
----

===== Troubleshooting
1. LCD screen not turning on: Check all connections, ensure the LCD is placed correctly, and check the power source
2. Make sure I2C is enabled. To enable, follow these steps:
a. Type the following command:
[source, bash, indent=1]
----
  $ sudo raspi-config
----
b. Use the arrow keys to navigate to "Interfacing Options" and press Enter.
c. Scroll down and select "I2C" using the arrow keys and press Enter.
d. When prompted whether to enable the ARM I2C interface, select "Yes."
e. Exit the configuration tool and reboot the Raspberry Pi with the following command for the changes to take effect:
[source, bash, indent=1]
----
  $ sudo reboot
----
