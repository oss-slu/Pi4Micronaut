===== Overview
This section provides details of the LED, including its components and assembly instructions.

===== Components
* 1 x RaspberryPi
* 1 x Breadboard
* 1 x T-Extension Board
* 1 x LED
* 2 x Jumper wires
* 1 x Resistor (220Ω)
* Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V)

===== Assembly

* Place a single LED onto the Breadboard.
* The LED will have two pins, a cathode and an anode.
* Connect the cathode (short pin) of the LED to GPIO 17.
* Connect the anode (long pin) to a 220Ω resistor on the positive side of the Breadboard.
* Connect the other end of the resistor to 3.3V
* Connect a jumper wire from GPIO 17 to the cathode of the LED.
* Connect another jumper wire from 3.3V to the positive side of the Breadboard.
* Two jumper wires should be connected to separate positions on the Breadboard and T-Extension Board.

===== Testing

Use: `curl http://localhost:8080/LED/LEDOn` to test the component. This will cause the LED to light.

===== Troubleshooting
- LED not lighting: Check the connections, and ensure the LED is placed correctly. Double-check the power source.
- LED is too dim: Resistor value may be too high. Verify you're using 220Ω or adjust according to the power source your using
as well as the LED specifications.
