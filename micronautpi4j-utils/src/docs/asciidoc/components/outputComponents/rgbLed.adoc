===== Overview
This document provides details of the RGB (Red-Green-Blue) LED circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. RGB LED
. 3 x 220Ω resistors (for current limiting)
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source (appropriate voltage, typically 3.3V or 5V)

===== Assembly Instructions
. Place the RGB LED on the Breadboard. The LED has four pins - one for each of the
colors (Red, Green, and Blue) and one common pin (either cathode or anode).
. Connect the Resistors. Attach a 220Ω resistor to each of the RGB pins of the LED.
This is to limit the current and protect the LED.
. Power Connections:
**  If using a common cathode RGB LED, connect the common pin directly to the
ground (GND) and the other ends of the resistors to the respective positive
terminals (like GPIO pins of a microcontroller or direct power source).
** If using a common anode RGB LED, connect the common pin directly to the
positive voltage source (VCC) and the other ends of the resistors to the respective
negative terminals (like GPIO pins set to OUTPUT and LOW on a microcontroller).

===== Functionality
The RGB LED can produce a wide range of colors by mixing different intensities of
Red, Green, and Blue. By adjusting the power to each pin, various colors can be
produced. For instance:

* Red: Power the Red pin while keeping Green and Blue off.
* Green: Power the Green pin while keeping Red and Blue off.
* Blue: Power the Blue pin while keeping Red and Green off.
* Yellow: Power both Red and Green pins while keeping Blue off.
* Cyan: Power both Green and Blue pins while keeping Red off.
* Magenta: Power both Red and Blue pins while keeping Green off.
* White: Power all three pins

===== Troubleshooting
. LED not lighting up: Check all connections, ensure the LED is placed correctly,
and check the power source.
. Only one color is working: One of the pins might have a loose connection. Verify
each color pin's connection.
. LED is too dim: The resistor value might be too high. Ensure you're using 220Ω or
adjust according to your power source and LED specifications

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring pins for a RGB LED component in the application.yaml file is as follows

*RED-PIN-INFO, GREEN-PIN-INFO, BLUE-PIN-INFO*

So in the case of

[source, yaml]
----
multi-pwm:
  rgb-led:
    addresses: 17, 18, 27
----

the red pin would be the one connected to GPIO 17, green to GPIO 18, and blue to GPIO 27. All lists of values for RGB LED components will follow the same order.
