===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring pins for a Rotary Encoder component in the application.yaml file is as follows

*SW-PIN-INFO, CLK-PIN-INFO, DT-PIN-INFO*

So in the case of

[source, yaml]
----
multi-digital-input:
  rot-encoder:
    addresses: 17, 18, 27
----

the sw pin would be the one connected to GPIO 17, the clk pin would be connected to GPIO 18, and the dt pin would connect to GPIO 27. All lists of values for Rotray Encoder components will follow the same order.
