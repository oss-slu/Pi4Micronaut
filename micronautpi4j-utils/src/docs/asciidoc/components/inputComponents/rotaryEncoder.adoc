===== Overview
This section provides details of the Rotary Encoder circuit,
including its components, assembly instructions, and functionality.

===== Components
. Rotary encoder module
. 1 x 10kÎ© resistor
. Breadboard
. Jumper wires
. Power source

===== Assembly Instructions
Connect the 5 pins on the encoder to the breadboard along with the resistor as
stated below and in the diagram.

. Ground: Connect ground on the encoder to ground on the breadboard
. Power: Connect the + on the encoder to the 3.3V on the breadboard
. SW: Connect SW to GPIO 27 on the breadboard
. DT: Connect DT to GPIO 17 on the breadboard
. CLK: Connect CLK to GPIO 18 on the breadboard
. Resistor: Place the resistor horizontally so that it is parallel
  with GPIO 27, having one side on the red + with the other next to the wire on GPIO 27
. Connect a wire from 3.3V to the red + in the same column as the resistor

===== Circuit Diagram

- Note the resistor location at GPIO 27

===== Functionality
- The initial value returned is 0.
- Turning the shaft one unit clockwise will increase the value returned by 1, whereas, turning the
  knob counterclockwise by one unit will decrease the value returned by 1.
- The value returned is an integer with a max value of 2147483647 and min of -2147483647.

===== Testing the Circuit
To return the value of the rotary encoder:

[source, bash]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rotaryEncoder/value
----

===== Troubleshooting
- Value not being returned: Make sure all pins on the encoder match up
  to the correct GPIO pins according to the YAML pin order below.
- Make sure that a 10k resistor is being used

===== YAML Pin Order
The order for declaring pins for a Rotary Encoder component in the application.yaml file is as follows

*SW-PIN-INFO, CLK-PIN-INFO, DT-PIN-INFO*

So in the case of

[source, yaml]
----
multi-digital-input:
  rot-encoder:
    addresses: 17, 18, 27
----

the sw pin would be the one connected to GPIO 27, the clk pin would be connected to GPIO 18, and the dt pin would connect to GPIO 17. All lists of values for Rotary Encoder components will follow the same order.
