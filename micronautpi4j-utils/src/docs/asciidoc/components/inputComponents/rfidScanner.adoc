===== Overview
This section provides information regarding the RFID scanner component and its circuit, including assembly instructions.


===== Components

* RFID-RC522
* RFID key fob
* 9 x Jumper Wires
* Breadboard
* Power source (3.3V)




===== Assembly Instructions

* Put RFID scanner on breadboard as shown in the diagram below.
* Connect the RFID ground to the ground on the Pi, and connect the 3.3V pin of the RFID scanner to the 3V3 pin of the Pi.
* Connect the rest of the RFID pins to the corresponding pins on the Pi.


===== Circuit Diagram
Model:

===== Functionality
The two main functions of the RFID scanner are to read RFIDs and to write to them. What is written to the RFID will vary depending on the intended use for the scanner.

===== Troubleshooting

Make sure everything is connected to the correct pins.

===== Testing the Circuit:

To write to the RFID fob: `curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rfid/write/{message}`

Example:
[source]
----
$ curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/rfid/write/HelloThere
----
Scan the key fob to write the message to the fob.

To read from the RFID fob: `curl http://localhost:8080/rfid/read`

Example:
[source]
----
$ curl http://localhost:8080/rfid/read
----
Scan the key fob and the message on the fob will be printed.
[source]
----
HelloThere
----
