Multipin components are unique in that they require several of the same type of pin in order to function properly.
Each class of multipin component (Digital Input, PWM), is declared slightly differently in the application.yaml file

.Example Multipin Digital Input declaration
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../../../../../components/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=multiInput]
----
<.> Top level field for multipin digital inputs (equivlent of digital-output declaration)
<.> Component Identifier (Used in @Named annotations)
<.> Component Name
<.> Addresses for each pin (Each component has a specific order outlined in the component description)
<.> Debounce values for each pin (same order as above)
<.> Pull values for each pin (same order as above)
<.> Shutdown value (All pins have the same shut down)
<.> Startup value (All pins have the same start up)
<.> Provider (All pins have the same provider)

.Example Multipin PWM declaration
[source, yaml]
----
include::../../../../../../components/src/main/resources/application.yml[tags=multipwm]
----
<.> Top level field for multipin PWMs (equivlent of digital-output declaration)
<.> Component Identifier (Used in @Named annotations)
<.> Component Name
<.> Addresses for each pin (Each component has a specific order outlined in the component description)
<.> PWM types for each pin (same order as above)
<.> Provider (All pins have the same provider)
<.> Startup values (Same order as above)
<.> Shutdown values (Same order as above)
