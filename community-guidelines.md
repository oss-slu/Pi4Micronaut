# Community Guidelines

The Pi4Micronaut is an Open source project. Our goal is to create a Java library using the Micronaut Framework and Pi4J to streamline the process of creating IoT web applications which utilize hardware connectivity to Raspberry Pi's.

The Micronaut Foundation™ is a not-for-profit organization that serves to:
- Ensure technical innovation and advancement of the Micronaut framework as a free and open public-use software development toolkit for a growing global community
- Evangelize and promote the Micronaut framework as a leading technology in the JVM space
- Build and support an ecosystem of complementary documentation, functionality, and services

We are very pleased and grateful for our partnership with the Unity Foundation. The Unity Foundation™ is a non-profit, community-based organization that is using open source technology to bridge the digital divide in disadvantaged communities. 

The Unity Foundation is committed to leveraging open source software tools to provide more inherently equitable access to the information and services that support the needs of the greater community, with a focus on the underserved. Unity develops and aggregates several open source tools and systems that can be used to develop custom software solutions to address the specific needs of different communities. By providing open and transparent access to these tools and resources, the Unity Foundation is working with a network of community partners to create more equitable access to technology and the internet. 

The Micronaut Foundation, a subsidiary of the Unity Foundation, NP supports their mission and vision to collaborate with social service organizations and other support providers to develop grass-root, holistic, sustainable technology-based solutions that help uplift individuals in underserved communities. This partnership provides a meaningful alliance between Unity and our amazing community. We are excited for the opportunity to work closely with Unity to further develop an open source technology infrastructure and ecosystem supporting our underserved communities. As Unity continues its commitment to serve as an OSS aggregator, this will scale community participation in helping define, advance, and contribute to the ongoing success and sustainability of the Micronaut framework.

Together we believe that “all of us” is better than any one of us. We desire very simply to serve our community through partnering with other members of our community who also want to uplift and empower everyone. Together, we can ideate, prioritize, and build new or leverage existing technology and tools needed to address the digital divide.

Our commitment to the core values of IDEA:

- Inclusive 
- Diverse

As part of our commitment to empowering our global community, we help to ensure the continuity and advancement of several open source projects.

As a steward for the Micronaut open source community, the Foundation shares in the responsibility to communicate expectations, moderate public discourse, and respond to abuse as necessary. By outlining our mission, values, and what we expect within our community, we hope to help you understand how best to collaborate with us in public Micronaut forums.

Reports of abuse will be investigated, and reports of abuse may result in active moderation of any content that we determine to be in violation of these guidelines.
